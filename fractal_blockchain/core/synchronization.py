# Prompt 7: Build fractal synchronization protocol.
# - Timestamp cascade: time flows from Genesis Triad down through fractal levels.
# - Heartbeat (synchronization) at each level.
# - Global clock synchronization across infinite levels (conceptual, focus on data structures that could support this).
# - Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) for timestamp consensus (out of scope for Phase 1 math).
# - Drift correction and outlier removal algorithms (out of scope for Phase 1 math).

# For Phase 1, we'll focus on basic data structures and concepts.
# Full BFT or complex clock sync algorithms are beyond this scope.

# --- Global Clock Synchronization Concepts (Notes for future) ---
# - **NTP-like protocols:** Nodes could synchronize with reference clocks or peers.
# - **Vector Clocks / Lamport Timestamps:** For event ordering in distributed systems, less about wall-clock time.
# - **BFT Consensus on Timestamps:** Validators could agree on timestamps for blocks/levels.
#   This is complex and involves consensus algorithms (Paxos, Raft, PBFT variants).
# - **Drift Correction:** Nodes would monitor clock drift against references and adjust.
# - **Outlier Removal:** Ignore timestamps from peers that are too far off the median/average.

# For the "timestamp cascade":
# - Genesis Triad: Could get time from a secure external source or be defined at launch.
# - Parent nodes propagate their effective time to children.
# - This propagation could be part of block creation or a separate sync message.
